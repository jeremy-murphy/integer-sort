integer-sort
============

C++ implementation of textbook integer sorting algorithms (with a view to inclusion in Boost).

The C++ standard library includes comparison sort functions, which run in Ο(n lg n) time.
Counting sort algorithms can sort in Θ(n).  See CLRS for details.

Currently, there is a stable counting-sort, unstable in-place counting-sort and a stable LSD radix sort.
